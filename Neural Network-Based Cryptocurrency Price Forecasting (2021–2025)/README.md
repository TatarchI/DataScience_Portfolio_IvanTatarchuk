# üìâ Neural Network for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting

## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates how neural networks (Dense and LSTM) can be used to forecast cryptocurrency prices using historical time series data.\
The main objective is to predict real future prices based on structured preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter optimization.

The project is organized into three operational modes:

1. Mode 1: Synthetic training using artificially generated noisy data + live animation of predictions.
2. Mode 2: Real-time forecasting based on actual crypto prices from 2021‚Äì2025.
3. Mode 3: Grid-based hyperparameter optimization for both Dense and LSTM models.

## üìÄ Data Source

Cryptocurrency data was collected from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) and includes:

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Solana (SOL)

Data spans from **early 2021 to mid-2025** and is provided in an Excel file (`prices.xlsx`) in long format (Coin, Date, Price).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Structure

### `load_and_prepare_crypto_prices(...)`

Parses long-format Excel into a wide-format time series with columns:

```
[Date, BTC_Price, ETH_Price, SOL_Price]
```

### `plot_crypto_prices(...)`

Displays price trends with half-year granularity (H1/H2 per year) across all 3 coins.

---

### Mode 1 ‚Äî `train_model_with_animation(...)`

- Generates synthetic noise-based tensor data for neural network training.
- Trains a `Dense` model in live mode with real-time visualization of prediction convergence.

This allows observing how the model adapts even with distorted or noisy input, showing learning behavior.

---

### Mode 2 ‚Äî `run_real_forecast(...)`

- Uses actual price history to train/test forecasting models.
- Supports two architectures:
  - `Dense` custom model with multiple hidden layers.
  - `LSTM` (Keras Sequential API).
- Forecasts are made for BTC, ETH, and SOL on the test set (Feb‚ÄìJun 2025).
- Model weights are loaded from best configurations previously saved in `.h5` files.

---

### Mode 3 ‚Äî `optimize_dense_model(...)` & `optimize_lstm_model(...)`

Performs full grid search over architectural and training hyperparameters for each model:

- Dense search includes:

  - Layer architectures: `[64, 32]`, `[128, 64, 32]`, etc.
  - Activation: `relu`, `tanh`, `elu`
  - Optimizers: `Adam`, `Nadam`
  - Dropout rates: `0.0`, `0.1`

- LSTM search includes:

  - Units: `32`, `64`, `128`
  - Optimizers and learning rates
  - Batch sizes

The best model is saved to `best_dense_weights.h5` or `best_lstm_weights.h5` and used in Mode 2.

## üìä Results Summary

| Model            | MAE (USD) | R¬≤ Score | Notes                       |
| ---------------  | --------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Bitcoin (Dense)  | ‚âà 1768    | 0.943    | Best configuration          |
| Bitcoin (LSTM)   | ‚âà 1968    | 0.923    | Slightly lower              |
| Ethereum (Dense) | ‚âà 71      | 0.921    | Stable without optimization |
| Solana (Dense)   | ‚âà 5.3     | 0.850    | General trend captured      |

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Dense model outperformed LSTM due to shorter memory dependencies and faster convergence.
- Training & test data were strictly separated by date to prevent leakage.
- Inverse-scaling of outputs** was properly applied before calculating `MAE` and `R¬≤` on raw prices.
- Custom class showcases manual architecture construction (with initializer, dropout, etc.).
- Code can be easily extended to other coins by updating the input Excel file.
