Horrible app. They are pretty much scammers. I ordered something and they almost doubled the payment amount stated do to 'transport costs' and the order was even WRONG! you guys are scammers and you make sure no one can call to make a complaint,1,2022-07-10T13:34:55,en
"The map for Belgrade is not exact. When i type an adress it show that pin is on different place and that confuses the couriers. Then i put the pin at the exact place, and it shows the wrong address. And of course that also confuses the couriers. Maps.me has the best map, it has every house number. You should try and work with them :)",4,2022-07-10T08:53:34,en

If you‚Äôre placing an order but decide to go back to check other restaurants sometimes the app just throws an error and when you go back to the list the place you were just ordering from will be gone.

The most useless delivery service i have ever seen in tbilisi Gldani. I ordered for french flies at Macdonalds. The glovo delivery guy came to my location without calling me or even coming to my apartment. I just saw on my app that it has been canceled. I contacted them and they didnt give me any reasonable reason and they still put the bills on my app. Now i have outstanding bill. This glovo need be rated negative zero.

"Most of my favorite restaurants are gone. The search option isn't working. It's telling me that a restaurant that is no more than half an hour away from me BY FOOT is outside of my delivery zone. Takes years to load and is extremely buggy. Do better, please.",1,2022-06-03T17:17:45,en

"The expected time of delivery is manipulated on purpose and doesn't correspond with reality. At first, you think the restaurant or the delivery is slow, but no - Glovo Bulgaria is just lying about the delivery times. Spoke to a restaurant owner that has notified Glovo many times about that underperformance, but Glovo does nothing. I asked Customer service to get a call from a manager to discuss the major issue with their service. 36h later, no call. The management needs a serious shake up.",1,2022-06-03T13:44:19,en
